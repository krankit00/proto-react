    content:`On 14 September 2020, a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped in Hathras district, Uttar Pradesh, India. After fighting for 
    her life for two weeks, she died in a Delhi hospital. Initially, it was reported that one accused had tried to kill her, though later 
    in her statement to the magistrate, the victim named four accused as having raped her. 
    
    The police registered a complaint on 20 September 2020 and were able to record a statement from the victim on 22 
    September 2020. The victim was initially admitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh on 14 
    September with her spinal cord severely damaged and was later shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi after her 
    conditions worsened. 
    
    She died on 29 September 2020. The victim was cremated at about 2:30am on 29 September 2020 by the Uttar Pradesh 
    Police. Following the cremation, Allahabad High Court has taken suo moto cognizance of the case asking the family, the 
    District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to appear before it.`,
    facts: [
        `There are some news sources which reported that the victim was cremated in the middle of the night without the 
        permission of the family and the authorities are misleading people saying the family had been present at the 
        funeral. [1]`,

        `There are some news sources which reported that the police had taken permissions from the family prior to 
        cremation and the family was now lying. [2]`,

        `Some news sources reported that the UP administration and police have clearly established using forensic 
        evidence that no rape occured. [3]`,

        `Some news have reported that the administration is pushing false propoganda and questioned the analysis of “no 
        rape” with the victims official statement mentioning rape. [4]`,

    headline: 'CAA-NRC Protests',
    date: Date(2020, 10, 19),
    content:`The Citizenship Amendment Act protests (CAA Protests) are a series of nationwide protests that occurred after the 
    Government of India introduced and subsequently enacted the Citizenship Amendment Act in the parliament. The protests 
    started primarily in Assam on 4 December 2019 after the bill was introduced in the Parliament. Later, protests erupted across 
    Northeast India and eventually spread to the major cities in India.
    
    On 15 December, protests were held across the campuses of Jamia Millia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University, 
    facing retaliation by the police. Around the same time, protests started in the area of Shaheen Bagh participated in mainly by 
    house wives and old women who were sitting on roads as a sign of peaceful resistance. On 5 January 2020, a masked mob 
    allegedly composed of Hindu extremists armed with rods and sticks attacked the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University. The 
    act was later alleged to be an attempt to suppress activism in the CAA Protests.
    
    Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled his visit to Assam while the protests continued in Assam and across the nation. On 10 
    January, the Delhi High Court dismissed a plea to remove the protestors occupying Shaheen Bagh, while the CAA Protests 
    had spread to a majority of states in the country. 
    
    On 14 January the Kerala Government approached the Supreme Court to challenge the CAA under Section 131 of the 
    Constitution and became the first state to do so. By 17 January, inspired by the Shaheen Bagh protests, a massive protest was 
    started in Mumbai and smaller ones in other parts of the country. On 30 January, a man opened fire at the protests in Jamia 
    Millia and another on the protestors in Shaheen Bagh on 1 February. 
    
    Amnesty International subsequently informed the US lawmakers that the CAA clearly violated International human rights and 
    legitimized discrimination on the basis of religion. On 3 March, the UN High Commissioner for human rights filed an 
    intervention plea in the Supreme Court to be made a party in the CAA Protest case.`,
    facts: [
        `CAA Protests in Assam are different from the rest of the country and don’t have religious discrimination as the 
        primary motivation as reported by some sources. [1]`,
        
        `It was reported by some media sources that the student protestors had caused violence and burned buses 
        resulting in the police entering into Jamia campus to detain perpetrators. [2]`,
        
       `A few media sources reported that the students had claimed not being involved in the violence which was being 
        used to malign the protests and incite violence. [3]`,
        
        `It was later revealed in the investigations that the 10 people arrested were not Jamia students and Jamia student 
        protestors had not been involved in the violence earlier. [4]`,
        
        `Some reports of violence in West Bengal with trains being attacked by protestors [5] whereas other reports on the 
        issue claimed to reveal that the people involved in the attack were affiliated with the BJP. [6]`,
        
        `There were claims by some sources that the shooting at Shaheen Bagh was motivated by the Union Minister and 
        fueled by BJP supporters. [7] `

    content:`On 14 June 2020, Indian actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead hanging from the ceiling fan at his home in Bandra, 
    Mumbai, India. A team of three doctors submitted a provisional post-mortem with the cause of death mentioned as “asphyxia 
    due to hanging”. A final post-mortem report was received on 25 June. 
    
    On 25 July 2020, Sushant’s father, KK Singh, filed an FIR in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty and six others, including her 
    family members, for abetment of suicide. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which investigates financial crimes, also 
    registered a money laundering case over transactions worth 150 million based on the complaint registered by Sushant’s 
    father. In a petition filed to the Supreme Court, Rhea Chakraborty claimed that she had no role in the death of Sushant and 
    also requested for the FIR to be transferred to the Mumbai Police. The Mumbai police said there was no misappropriation of 
    funds and appointed Grant Thornton as the financial forensic auditor on 4 August. 
    
    On 6 August 2020, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) re-registered the FIR and on 19 August, the Supreme Court 
    allowed the CBI to take control of the investigation. On 26 August, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) registered an FIR 
    against Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and three others. On 3 October 2020, Dr Sudhir Gupta of AIIMS, leader of the 
    forensic team designated by CBI reported that Sushant’s death is a case of suicide. On 5 October, ANI reported that AIIMS had 
    submitted their medical report directly to the CBI for further review.`,
    facts: [
